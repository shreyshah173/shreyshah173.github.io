title: Docker 3 Tier Architecture Tutorial!
---
To deploy a Three-Tier Application using Docker, the initial step involves setting up a Full Stack Project. While any Full Stack Project can be utilized for this purpose, if one isn't available, an alternative project can be employed. In this instance, a straightforward project hosted on GitLab is utilized. The project, accessible via the link [developing-with-docker](https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/developing-with-docker), is constructed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, and MongoDB.

To commence, clone the Project Repository using the following command:

`git clone https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/developing-with-docker`

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).
